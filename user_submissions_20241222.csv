She was awarded her PhD in Glaciology (geophysics) from the University of Copenhagen Centre for Ice and Climate, Niels Bohr Institute in 2015 and following this worked as a research glaciologist at the Norwegian Polar Institute and then as a remote sensing specialist at Asiaq. She was also chosen to participate in the Arctic Frontiers Emerging Leaders programme, an international and cross-cultural platform for dialogue and exchange to support the arctic leaders of the future.  As a researcher at Asiaq, Alex conducts fieldwork around Greenland, including for the Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring GeoBasis and Glaciobasis programmes and works on wide-ranging national and international projects. Alex is passionate about developing research projects that include local involvement, collaboration and knowledge-sharing with ﬁeldwork and dissemination. For example, her project funded by the Greenlandic Research Council maps snowline evolution on one of Nuuk’s local glaciers in Kobbefjord and works with local guides who can share their knowledge about snow conditions in the Nuuk region. Another of her current collaborative projects, funded by the Nordic Arctic Co-operation Programme, aims to educate tourists and local communities about the natural hazards encountered in Greenland and the wider Arctic. She is also developing a project to map avalanche risk in Nuuk’s backcountry that can be used by local people for route planning and risk assessment, with involvement from the local search and rescue team and snow scooter club and their experience in avalanche occurrence."

I have investigated uncharted glacial fjords in the Northwest Passage, Devon Ice Cap and what ocean forces are influencing their melt. In 2022 I kick of a decadal Arctic mapping project across the remaining glacial fjords in Greenland, the Canadian Arctic and Alaska. This project is called GO-MARIE Glacier Mapping and Research Interdisciplinary Effort. I will commission the polar expedition vessel RV Marie Tharp next Spring and sail her back to Greenland to kick off the mapping effort that is part of the Seabed2030 United Nation endorsed initiative.

65.62202261510642,-38.935546875,Louise Arner Boyd,Female,"1887-1972","Between 1926 and 1955, American-born Louise Arner Boyd organized, financed and lead seven expeditions by sea to Greenland, Spitsbergen, Jan Mayen Land and Franz Josef Land. One of her earliest trips assisted the 1928 rescue expedition which sought to locate missing Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. As her experience grew, so too did the scope of the scientific work conducted on each successive voyage. She hired experts from around the world to carry out field work in geology, oceanography, ecology, glaciology and geomorphology. Supported by the American Geographical Society, Boyd published several books about her adventures including The Fiord Region of East Greenland (1935) and The Coast of Northeast Greenland with Hydrographic Studies in the Greenland Sea (1948). Although her primary role on each trip was as expedition leader, she also served as the ship botanist and photographer. Her detailed photographs, maps and data relating to Greenlandic glacier recession remain of keen interest to contemporary scientists studying climate change.   Boyd’s bravery and scientific contributions won international renown and she received honorary degrees and awards from Norway, France, Sweden, Poland and the United States. She dedicated her whole life to the cause of polar exploration and poured her personal fortune into expeditions aimed at advancing modern science and satisfying her own profound curiosity about the north. Despite the high regard in which she was held by other explorers and scientists during her lifetime, Louise Arner Boyd paid a heavy price and her extraordinary life has largely been forgotten today."

This lengthy and arduous expedition established cultural connections between the Inuit cultures in Greenland, the United States and Canada and identified the historic origins of the Indigenous Greenlandic people. As a skilled and vital expedition member, Arnarulunnguaq travelled with Rasmussen from Greenland by dogsled, across the Northwest Passage through Alaska and Arctic Canada. As with other Indigenous members of the group, she assumed many roles including translator, guide, dog-driver, seamstress, hunter and cook. Most significantly, given this expedition’s considerable accomplishments, she demonstrated her critical skills as an ethnographer through the interviews she conducted and the connections she made between different Inuit peoples of the region. Arnarulunnguaq’s work includes exquisitely rendered drawings of the tattooing practices of Netsilik Inuit women (published in Rasmussen’s 1931 The Netsilik Eskimos: Social Life and Spiritual Culture). In 1924, she was awarded the Silver Medal of Merit from the Danish government. While her image appears on a Greenlandic postage stamp and she is lauded in a poem by prominent Greenlandic poet and politician Aqqaluk Lynge, plans to erect a permanent statue recognizing her accomplishments, have floundered."

Working as a teacher and then a nurse, she married journalist/adventurer Leonidas Hubbard Jr. in 1901. They shared a love of the outdoors and an interest in hiking, boating and nature. In 1903, her husband lead an ill-starred and poorly executed journey up the Naskaupi River into the interior of Labrador. Two years later, following his death by starvation, Mina Benson Hubbard organized and participated in her own rugged expedition to complete her husband’s work to map and photograph this wilderness region. Working with a small team of Métis Cree local guides, Hubbard travelled six hundred miles by canoe from the community of North West River, up the Naskaupi River to Lake Michikimau and then north to the George River outpost on Ungava Bay. Following the successful completion of this arduous two-month undertaking, the first accurate map of the Labrador river system was created. Her book about the expedition entitled A Woman’s Way Through Unknown Labrador, was published in 1908 and provided a detailed and illustrated account of her interactions with the local Innu, Cree, Métis and Inuit and the landscape of the region. Mina Benson Hubbard was named a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and a National Historical Person by the Canadian government in 2018."

Educated at a Methodist missionary school, she married young and bore three children- two of whom died as infants. In 1921, divorcing her abusive husband and desperate to earn enough money to care for her surviving child, she accepted the position of seamstress with a four-man expedition to remote Wrangel Island. Organized by Vilhjalmur Stefansson, the team’s objective was to claim and begin colonizing Wrangel for the British Empire. Stefansson was a renowned and charismatic anthropologist and explorer but had a controversial past. Only years earlier, his Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913-1918 had travelled to the same location. But things ended tragically with Stefansson’s abandonment of his crew and eleven team members dead.  Ada Blackjack was the only Indigenous person and only woman on the 1921 Expedition. Despite her initial lack of outdoor skills and poor treatment by her male colleagues, she proved to be the hardiest and most resilient member of the group. After travelling to Wrangel, the team suffered hardship after the scheduled supply ship failed to appear in 1922. Ada Blackjack spent two years on Wrangel and was the sole survivor of the expedition. Afterwards, she never received her full salary or any benefits from her participation in the expedition. She remarried and lived quietly in Alaska until her death in 1983."

Toasted by Gorbachev and Reagan (https://www.nps.gov/people/lynne-cox.htm).  In her words:  “My Bering Strait swim in 1987 was one of my most important achievements.  I swam from Little Diomede, USA, to Big Diomede, to open the border between the US and the Soviet Union.  Years later, in 2007, I did a series of swims through the Arctic starting in Greenland, with a swim across Disco Bay in 26.6ºF water (–3ºC) wearing a swimsuit, cap, and goggles.  My objective was to show that we are capable of pushing beyond established limitations.  The swim was part of a series of swims through the Arctic.  I next swam 1 mile in 28.8ºF water (–2ºC) in 25 minutes.  From there I did a mile swim off Gjoa Haven in the Canadian Arctic, a mile swim through Prudhoe Bay, and a mile swim off Barrow in the Chukchi Sea.  I was tracing the route of Roald Amundsen and writing about his being the first person [to navigate there] – probably European person, because there may have been Inuit people who traveled through the Northwest Passage before him.  I wrote about his experience and mine in the book ‘South with The Sun’.  The swims for me were about mapping new territories, entering waterways where no one intentionally swims, exploring the possibilities, and pushing beyond limits.”"

Here she was engaged in hunting, food preparation and distribution as well as assisting in the collection of ethnological data. In 1894, she travelled to Greenland for a second time. Her books about Greenland for adults and children are illuminating as they mirror the prevalent exoticized attitudes towards Indigenous peoples of the North and reflect one Western woman’s perspective about Inuit culture and way of life. She had a conflicted relationship with Peary’s Inuit “country wife” Aleqasina who herself provided Peary with a home base, mothered two of his children, sewed his clothing and offered him emotional support prior to his expeditions. Diebitsch-Peary’s written work and her correspondence highlight the historic colonialist relationships that existed between Westerners and Indigenous peoples in Greenland. Despite controversies that swirled around Robert Peary, she remained committed to him throughout her life.
